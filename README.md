## Overview
This project analyzes the **Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)** to evaluate progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy)**.  

The focus is on the **Energy Equity Gap**—the disparity between infrastructure (electricity access) and quality of life (clean cooking)—and the effectiveness of financial flows.
